After years of meaning to start a blog and never quite getting around to it, here we are.

## why now

I spend a lot of time reading other people's technical writing — blog posts that explain something just slightly off the beaten path, that save hours of debugging, that make a concept click. I want to contribute to that pool.

This isn't going to be a "top 10 tips" site. It'll be notes on things I've actually worked through: systems design decisions, tools I've switched to (and why), things that surprised me in production.

## what this site is

A static site built with [Astro](https://astro.build). The stack is intentionally minimal:

- Astro 5 for the framework
- Plain CSS with a terminal-ish aesthetic
- Markdown for content
- Deployed as static HTML

No JavaScript framework, no component library. The fastest page is a page with nothing on it.

## what to expect

Posts will be infrequent but (hopefully) worth reading. Topics will drift around systems programming, developer tooling, and whatever I'm currently obsessed with.

If something is wrong or you want to discuss something, find me on GitHub or Twitter — links are on the homepage.
